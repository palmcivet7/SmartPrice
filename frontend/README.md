Welcome to SmartPrice!

SmartPrice is a cutting-edge solution designed to provide you with an inflation-adjusted price for your products and services. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and Chainlink oracles, we offer a seamless way to calculate your prices while taking inflation into account.

Our platform utilizes Chainlink to fetch the latest inflation data from Truflation, a trusted source for accurate inflation metrics. To ensure smooth and reliable smart contract execution, we've integrated Chainlink Automation, which automates the entire process, making it convenient and hassle-free for our users.

Please note that currently, only whole number dollar values can be submitted for base prices. We're actively working to improve our platform, and we'll soon offer support for decimal values as well.

SmartPrice is currently available on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. We're excited to have you join our community and experience the benefits of using SmartPrice for your business. By incorporating our solution, you can confidently adjust your pricing strategies according to the ever-changing economic landscape. Together, let's build a more resilient and profitable future!
